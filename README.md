👋 Hello, I'm itnunu751, an aspiring cybersecurity analyst with a relentless curiosity for all things related to digital security. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

🔐 About Me:
I'm on a mission to safeguard digital landscapes from evolving threats. 
My journey in cybersecurity has been marked by hands-on experience in IT consulting, continuous learning, and a commitment to strengthening cyber defenses.

🛠️ Key Skills:
My toolkit includes a wide range of skills and competencies:

CompTIA Security+ CE

Secure Coding Practices

🚀 Projects:
I'm a firm believer in learning by doing. Explore my GitHub repositories to find projects that demonstrate my expertise, including:
-	Created a minimal HTTP 1.1 server, based on RFC 2616, using the C standard library as a “backdoor” that would execute commands embedded into client requests 
-	Reverse engineered a password from a binary x86_64 program using objdump and Ghidra
-	Performed black-box security audits of small web applications using a browser, HTTP request sender, and Burp Suite to develop exploits for common web vulnerabilities
-	Spoofed IP addresses using the Python scapy package to gain the trust of UDP and TCP services and capture sensitive data
-	Developed a simple fuzzer to fuzz binary programs 

📚 Learning Never Stops:
I'm committed to staying at the forefront of cybersecurity trends. I just recently earned my CompTIA Security+ CE. Currently, I'm pursuing my Master's in Cybersecurity as well as the CompTIA CySa+ certification.
